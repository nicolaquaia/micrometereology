# Micrometeorology Reports  
**Developed for DTU Course 46100: Introduction to Micrometeorology for Wind Energy (Autumn 2023)**  

This repository contains reports and accompanying code for four assignments completed during the course. Each assignment delves into critical micrometeorological concepts and methods applied to wind energy. Below is a summary of the topics covered in each assignment:  

---

### **Assignment 1: Mean Wind Speed and the Weibull Distribution**  
- Extracted statistical properties from wind measurements.  
- Computed Weibull distribution parameters (scale \(A\) and shape \(k\)) and analyzed seasonal trends.  

---

### **Assignment 2: Wind Profiles, Shear, and Stability**  
- Computed friction velocity (\(u_*\)) and roughness length (\(z_0\)).  
- Evaluated the logarithmic and power laws using vertical profiles of mean wind speed over horizontally homogeneous terrain.  

---

### **Assignment 3: Turbulence and Spectra**  
- Computed temporal wind spectra using a smoothing filter to average neighboring frequency bins logarithmically.  
- Verified the -5/3 spectral slope characteristic of the inertial subrange.  
- Created synthetic time-series data based on the Kaimal spectrum for turbulent wind modeling.

### **Assignment 4: Simple Wind Resource and Site Assessments**  
The assignment consists of two parts:  
1. **Wind Resource Assessment**  
   - Estimated Annual Energy Production (AEP) for two potential turbine sites near the Great Belt: Nyborg (western) and Korsør (eastern).  
   - Examined inter-annual variability and its impact on AEP.  
   - Discussed the influence of mesoscale modeling results on AEP calculations.  

2. **Site Assessment**  
   - Estimated extreme wind speeds (\(V_{50}\)) for Sprogø and extrapolated them to Nyborg and Korsør.  
   - Analyzed directional characteristics of extreme winds and their implications for turbine design.  
   - Recommended appropriate turbine classes for the assessed sites.
